This project is a bilingual informational website for the Jordanian Sign Language Interpreters Association. It aims to provide details about the organization's goals, structure, and activities in both English and Arabic, while showcasing web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project was created as part of a course assignment and aligns with the goals outlined in the approved proposal: building a user-friendly, accessible website to support deaf communities.
